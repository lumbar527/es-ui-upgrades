# es-ui-upgrades
A plugin for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) that transforms the ui to a be a little more digital: blue, not really transparent but has a sheen.

## Note: This plugin is incompatible with the High-DPI plugin.

## Installation
To install **es-ui-upgrades**, you have several options.
### Via github.com:
If you want the newest release, you can click on the green `<> Code` button and then click on `Download ZIP`
If you want a specific release, go to the releases page, click on the releases page, scroll to the release you want, and click on the `es-ui-upgrades.zip` button. You will download the plugin.
With both of these options, you will have to move the plugin into the `plugins` folder. If on Mac, that is `~/Library/Application\ Support/endless-sky/plugins`

### Via the command line:
First, you must go to the plugins directory with the command line:
```
cd path/to/plugins/folder/plugins
```
On a Mac, the path is
```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/endless-sky/plugins
```
Next, run this command:
```
git clone git@github.com:lumbar527/es-ui-upgrades.git
```
Now you have the plugin downloaded and in the correct folder.

Open ESLauncher2. Then, click on the `Plugins` tab. Scroll down until you find this plugin, then click this button with an arrow pointing to a box. That's it. If you want to delete it, click the red trash can next to it.
